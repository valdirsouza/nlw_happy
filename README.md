# nlw_happy

## This project is just for practicing purpose and it's part of NLW. Yeah, a little too late.

## Things I practiced or learned:

* some good arrow functions;
* a little overview on how async functions work;
* discovered how to send data from the back-end up to the view by using handlebars;
* some solving problems and debugging (quite primitive though);
* some design stuff such as using figma and thinking of how to transform those things into code;
* improved my css and html skill;
* the difference from javascript when there are applied on both server and client side
