### This project is just for practicing purpose and it's part of NLW. Yeah, a little too late.

### Things I've practiced or learned:

* some arrow functions stuff;
* a little overview on how async functions work;
* discovered how to send data from the back-end up to the view by using handlebars;
* some solving problems => debug code;
* some "design" related stuff such as using figma for prototyping and how to transform those things into lines of code;
* improved my javascript, css and html skills;
* how javascript behave when applied on both server and client side
